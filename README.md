# Computer-Repair
## PC/Computers
- In order to know how to fix computers/PCs you know what parts go into building a computer/PC. On the next slide I will list the parts that go into building a computer/PC
### Computer Parts
- Case
- Motherboard
- CPU (Processor)
- RAM (Memory)
- Storage Device (SSD, NVME SSD, HDD)
- Cooling (CPU, Chassis)
- Power Supply Unit
- Monitor
- Operating System
- Input devices, mouse, keyboard
#### How to identify which hardware component is falling in your computer 
1. Blue screen 101 -The blue screen of death often displays information about the driver that crashed or the type of error it encountered.
2. Check Hard Drive SMART Status - Hard drives have a built in S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) feature. The idea is that the hard drive monitors itself and will notice if it starts to fail, providing you with some advance notice before the drive fails completely.
3. Test RAM -If the computer writes data to RAM and the RAM returns different data because it’s malfunctioning, you may see application crashes, blue screens, and file system corruption.
4. Check  Heat levels - Overheating can result in blue screens, crashes, and abrupt shut downs. Your computer may be overheating because you’re in a very hot location, it’s ventilated poorly, a fan has stopped inside your computer, or it’s full of dust.
5. Stress Test CPU - You can use a utility like Prime95 to stress test your CPU. Such a utility will fore your computer’s CPU to perform calculations without allowing it to rest, working it hard and generating heat. If your CPU is becoming too hot, you’ll start to see errors or system crashes
6. Stress test Graphics Card - Your graphics card can also be stress tested. For example, if your graphics driver crashes while playing games, the games themselves crash, or you see odd graphical corruption, you can run a graphics benchmark utility like 3DMark.
